My sister was fond of traveling .Ever since graduating she had been determined to organize a trip to an old temple. Since transporting fare was expensive, she decided to use a bicycle to cycle there not caring about the disadvantages.Her stubborn attitude was alwas her shortcoming. Once she made up her mind to do something,no one could persuade her to change her mind. Finally, we gave in as usual though we preferred to take a train. After we prepared everything, including the schedule, reliable weather forecast and the insurance , we began our trip.
